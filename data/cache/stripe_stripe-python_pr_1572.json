By moving to it (from `setup.py`), we'll be able to simplify our dependencies and more cleanly tackle user issues like https://github.com/stripe/stripe-python/issues/1558. \r\n\r\nThis change is backwards compatible as long as you're using a package manager released in the last 7 years. There are no user-facing changes otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf that's enough information for your review, then great! Otherwise, read on.\r\n\r\n### More than you've ever wanted to know about Python packages\r\n\r\nPython packaging has been long been a sore spot in the ecosystem. It's complicated and there are a _lot_ of ways to do it (many of which are considered \"legacy\" or \"only for really specific circumstances\"). Good news though: there's been a lot of work to write real standards and move packages towards them. There are also now multiple tools that implement these standards with minimal configuration.\r\n\r\nAll packages must have a manifest file that declare the name, version, dependencies, etc (roughly equivalent to JS's `package.json`). Originally, this was handled in `setup.py`, a Python file that called some functions from the `setuptools` library to register static information about the package. This created a big headache for building and distributing package. Because dependencies were declared in a call to a Python function, you couldn't use them in that file before they were installed. But, you didn't know what to install before you executed the file. It was a big mess that you can read about in [great detail here](https://blog.ganssle.io/articles/2021/10/setup-py-deprecated.html).\r\n\r\nThe modern alternative is the `pyproject.toml` file, as introduced in [PEP 518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518). It can store much of the same information as `setup.py`, but can be parsed without executing anything (and in a language-agnostic way).\r\n\r\nOur Python package was written before this standardization happened, so it's still declared with the legacy (but [still supported](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/discussions/setup-py-deprecated/#setup-py-deprecated)) `setup.py` file. It's worked well enough, but lacks some of the modern packaging features we'd like to use. So, we moved!\r\n\r\nThe migration itself was straightforward. There's even a [nice guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/modernize-setup-py-project/#where-to-start). Most of the keys in `setup.py` have analogues in `pyproject.toml`. Plus, we can dynamically reference the contents of files and our build backend (more on that soon) will read them and sort everything out for us.\r\n\r\nHere's what happened to each property from `setup.py`:\r\n\r\n| property                        | outcome                        | notes                                                                                                                                                             |\r\n| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| `name`                          | migrated                       |                                                                                                                                                                   |\r\n| `version`                       | made into a string             |                                                                                                                                                                   |\r\n| `description`                   | migrated                       |                                                                                                                                                                   |\r\n| `long_description`              | removed                        | It's what shows up on the PyPI page.

The simpler half is the [build frontend](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Build-Frontend). It's responsible for parsing the `pyproject.toml`, creating an isolated virtualenv, installing the build backend, and running it. The backend takes a directory of Python files and produces a `whl` (a fancy `zip` that package managers can install; [docs](https://realpython.com/python-wheels/)).\r\n\r\nEver since https://github.com/stripe/stripe-python/pull/1494, we've used [build](https://github.com/pypa/build), which is a minimal frontend maintained by the Python Packaging Authority (the group behind PyPI itself). When a `build-system` isn't defined, it falls back to `setuptools.build_meta:__legacy__` as its backend ([docs](https://build.pypa.io/en/stable/differences.html#fallback-backend)), which is what we've been using.\r\n\r\nFor the backend, we could have kept using `setuptools`, which is still actively maintained. But, its longevity also means its takes a lot of configuration to get exactly what we need. Instead, I went with [flit](https://flit.pypa.io/en/stable/). It's much smaller, more focused, and opinionated. We've got a pure Python package, so we can use it without any configuration. It also means we can remove a bunch of now-unused configuration files like `MANIFEST.in`, `setup.cfg`, and `setup.py` itself.\r\n\r\nPut it all together... and we're about back where we started. But with an easier to maintain package and some new opportunities on the horizon!\r\n\r\n### What?\r\n\r\n- remove `setup.py` from `.flake8`. \r\n- simplify `.flake8` config to use `extend-ignore` instead of `ignore` (which doesn't require re-ignoring default rules)\r\n- remove outdated installation instructions from README\r\n- move all necessary `setup.py` configuration into `pyproject.toml` (see table above)\r\n- delete `setup.py`, `setup.cfg`, `LONG_DESCRIPTION.rst`, `MANIFEST.in`,  and `.coveragerc`, as they're no longer needed\r\n- add a static `version` to `pyproject.toml` and update the `update-version` justfile recipe to update it (similar to what we do in other languages)\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nI built the package locally and compared it against the one from PyPI. Here's what I found:\r\n\r\n- we dropped `py2` from the name of the wheel file (which is expected). We don't support Python 2, so we don't need it in the filename\r\n- the contents of the `.whl` files are identical (minus the change to the version declaration above)\r\n- Our sdist only includes production files (`pyproject.toml` and the contents of the `stripe` directory) rather than all the tests and examples too. This is more correct\r\n\r\nI also installed the package directly from each of the distribution methods and verified that everything worked as expected in the REPL.\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n\r\n- [DEVSDK-2765](https://go/j/DEVSDK-2765)\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n- ⚠️ The package has swapped from `setup.py` to `pyproject.toml`. As a result, we're dropping support for `pip < 10.0.0` (released April 2018). Most users won't notice this change.\r\n- Additionally, we're no longer shipping tests or examples in our sdist now, which should offer a small size reduction for the package if installed without the wheel (approx. 2.5MB unzipped)", "created_at": "2025-09-19T04:34:26Z", "updated_at": "2025-09-24T01:55:29Z", "closed_at": "2025-09-24T01:55:27Z", "merged_at": "2025-09-24T01:55:27Z", "merge_commit_sha": "f13c37814eac9fd9bccf15b354cc0d1e1e69027d", "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [], "milestone": null, "draft": false, "commits_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/stripe/stripe-python/pulls/1572/commits", "review_comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/stripe/stripe-python/pulls/1572/comments", "review_comment_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/stripe/stripe-python/pulls/comments{/number}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/stripe/stripe-python/issues/1572/comments", "statuses_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/stripe/stripe-python/statuses/128bf97baa65976df6116fa4720ec2c00ec538e1", "head": {"label": "stripe:remove-setup-py", "ref": "remove-setup-py", "sha": "128bf97baa65976df6116fa4720ec2c00ec538e1", "user": {"login": "stripe", "id": 856813, "node_id": "MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1NjgxMw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/856813?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/stripe", "html_url": "https://github.com/stripe", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stripe/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stripe/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stripe/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stripe/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stripe/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stripe/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stripe/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stripe/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stripe/received_events", "type": "Organization", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "repo": {"id": 1953389, "node_id": "MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTUzMzg5", "name": "stripe-python", "full_name": "stripe/stripe-python", "private": false, "owner": {"login": "stripe", "id": 856813, "node_id": "MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1NjgxMw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/856813?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/stripe", "html_url": "https://github.com/stripe", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stripe/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stripe/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stripe/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stripe/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stripe/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stripe/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stripe/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stripe/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stripe/received_events", "type": "Organization", "user_view_type": "public", "site_admin": false}, "html_url": "https://github.com/stripe/stripe-python", "description": "Python library for the Stripe API.
