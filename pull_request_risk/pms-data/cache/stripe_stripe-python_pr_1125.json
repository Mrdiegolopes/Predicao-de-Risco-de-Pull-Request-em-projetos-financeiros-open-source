`classifiers` at `setup.py`\r\n  * remove `pyright` from `tox.ini` since there's no corresponding `testenv` configuration\r\n  * ~~bump `black` to `23.11.0` to get support for `py311`/`py312` targets~~\r\n    [it looks like](https://github.com/Jamim/stripe-python/actions/runs/6817083959/job/18539818829#step:5:317) it's better to keep current version of `black` for now\r\n\r\nBest
