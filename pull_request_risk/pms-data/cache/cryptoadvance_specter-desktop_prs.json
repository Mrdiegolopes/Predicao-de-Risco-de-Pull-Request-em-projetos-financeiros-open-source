used. It should no longer be used as a library with dependencies but as an executable. For that this PR does separate the HWI functionality into its own core-extension and refactor the HWIBridge to have now this structure:\r\n[![](https://mermaid.ink/img/pako:eNqlkc9qwzAMxl_F-NSy9AXCLvsHK2ynHQYjYBRbSQWxHWyZtnR596Vxk7JedpgvsqRPv89GJ6m9QVlK3UGMzwRtAFs5MZ6HOnIAza-f28dApkVx_73ZiHNKDsIxF__SvlE9C7N0MrqlnHJPCIWHCaQOfaqjaoK3SneEjlc5FAK09snxOo8MN9TF71_IX9A95ac-TeqFe3f97G5Pc7VFVhYiY1ANuRZDH2h0Ws993fmIq6uTLKTFYIHMuISJXUneocVKluPVYAOp40pWbhilqTfA-GKIfZBlA13EQkJi_3F0WpYcEs6iyy4XVQ_uy_trjhPk_bL9cxh-AMrUsRI?type=png)](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/edit#pako:eNqlkc9qwzAMxl_F-NSy9AXCLvsHK2ynHQYjYBRbSQWxHWyZtnR596Vxk7JedpgvsqRPv89GJ6m9QVlK3UGMzwRtAFs5MZ6HOnIAza-f28dApkVx_73ZiHNKDsIxF__SvlE9C7N0MrqlnHJPCIWHCaQOfaqjaoK3SneEjlc5FAK09snxOo8MN9TF71_IX9A95ac-TeqFe3f97G5Pc7VFVhYiY1ANuRZDH2h0Ws993fmIq6uTLKTFYIHMuISJXUneocVKluPVYAOp40pWbhilqTfA-GKIfZBlA13EQkJi_3F0WpYcEs6iyy4XVQ_uy_trjhPk_bL9cxh-AMrUsRI)\r\n\r\nCommon code is in AbstractHWIBridge. The old implementation goes into the `Lib`, the new one in the `Binary`. The HWIlib implementation has the idea of a `client` which is used as a parameter in that notable function `_extract_xpubs_from_client(client, account)`. In order to reuse that method, i've created a `HwiBinaryClient` which behaves and has the methods of a hwilib client including a dummy `close()` method.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThe testing has improved seriously. As a tester, you need to attach the HWW and does a:\r\n```\r\npytest tests/test_hwi_rpc_trezor.py -m manual -s -vvv\r\n```\r\nThe `m manual` is needed as those tests will be omitted by default (for CI). The tests will unlock the trezor if needed (tester has to enter pin) and togglepassphrase (tester has to confirm).\r\nAll tests are in sequence run against both implementations with the very same asserts. That was quite helpful with implementing a second impl.\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\nThere is a new Config-key called `HWI_RPC_IMPL` which is either `lib' or `bin`. By default in the BaseConfig it is :\r\n```\r\nHWI_RPC_IMPL = os.getenv(\"HWI_RPC_IMPL\", \"bin\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo anyone can change it by env-var any time. We're leveraging that in the `pyinstaller/main.js` where we're setting `lib` as env-var which means that inside specterd/electron, still the \"old\" lib implementation should be relevant.",

machine, we have an issue as those binaries no longer work on intel based Macs.\r\n\r\n# Potential solutions\r\n1. We don't cross compile but use the old existing intel machine build the specterd. This is possible as we're not signing specterd but only the ElectronApp. This could potentially work but has the following known major challenges:\r\n  * we are relying on yet another manual step and have yet another 4th build-machine (apart from MacArm/Linux/windows)\r\n  * we need to pass the sha256 hash somehow into the electronApp.\r\n2. Cross Compile on the Arm Mac with a \"universal2\" python build environment. This needs to either be compiled yourself or you need to use the precompiled universal2 binary (e.g. [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31011/)). Both ways have there own challenges.\r\n\r\nBuilding it yourself is very tricky and difficult as you probably need to have native intel packages which, according to lots of comments on github issues is possible via a whole parallel brew installations for the intel platform\r\nThat is probably also true for the downloaded universal2 downloader where i already got issues installing pyinstaller itself\r\nI tend to continue with the dedicated machine as those cross-compiling stuff contains a lot of unknown unknowns to me.\r\n\r\n# Chosen solution\r\nWe'll create the build on the old intel machine without cross-compilation\r\n\r\nFor that, we're adjusting the format of the `version-data.json`, introducing the arch. The old format looks like this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n {\r\n   \"version\": \"v2.0.0-pre32\",\r\n   \"sha256\": \"aa049abf3e75199bad26fbded08ee5911ad48e325b42c43ec195136bd0736785\"\r\n }\r\n ```\r\n The new format looks like this:\r\n ```json\r\n  {\r\n   \"version\": \"v2.0.0-pre32\",\r\n   \"sha256\": {\r\n        \"arm64\": \"1204c8e0a87c9de59e49da8030bc368f332db6bcff542f257efd2170ac1931ad\",\r\n        \"x64\": \"5b0c3b756910500fcb59ad9c4bd0dba612cdd7a0c63841daec33141f13ad6f3d\"\r\n     }\r\n }\r\n ```\r\n\r\nAs a result, we now have two specterd-binaries for each release and the DMG is now a \"universal\" build which means it's now 250 MB big instead of 171 as before.\r\n\r\nSee the realeas-guide.md for more explanations about the build on OSX.

symlink in ubuntu which broke the linux-build. Therefore the change in `.gitlab-ci.yml`\r\n* test_requirements.txt does no longer exist. It's now located in the test-section of `pyproject.yml`\r\n* upgraded babel as a side-effect\r\n* `aioitertools==0.11.0` has been forgotten at the latest jade-PR\r\n* The `release-helper.py` does no longer need the `set_setup_py_version` command and the `install_wheel` command was not usable in order to test the build locally. The new way of figuring out which version we're on is done fully automatically by setuptools_scm. It creates versionstrings via `python3 -m setuptools_scm` like `2.0.4rc9.dev0+g72b1b9a9.d20240522`. Installing that needs something different that a fixed naming schema\r\n\r\nThe failed build is only the \"tag_specterext_dummy_repo\" job which doesn't work in my gitlab fork which i used to test the release process. Iinstead of `git tag v2.0.4-pre8 && git push upstream v2.0.4-pre8` i used `git tag v2.0.4-pre8 && git push origin v2.0.4-pre8`. This will trigger the sync to my personal gitlab fork which will in turn trigger the gitlab release to my github-fork: https://github.com/k9ert/specter-desktop/releases/tag/v2.0.4-pre8", "created_at":

time to fix them all though):\r\n- [x] Not sure why the test is failing as it seems like it's supposed to be ignoring spotbit entirely...\r\n- [x] The default spotbit configuration now supports mostly different exchanges than what Specter is expecting (see https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/spotbit/blob/master/spotbit.config). It seems Specter should maybe run its own Spotbit server to be able to customise this?\r\n- [ ] The historical API has changed to use `start` and `end` query parameter date time strings instead of

The import of the wallet works if Specter is already open or if it is closed.\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop/assets/70536101/e216f53a-5288-4b3c-88c6-9d86659125c2\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop/assets/70536101/c6797298-f584-4f9c-850a-74eca0add76f\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How to test this PR?\r\n```\r\ncd pyinstaller/electron\r\nnpx electron-builder build\r\n```\r\nYou need to build the app to make the registering of the URI handler work (see https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/launch-app-from-url-in-another-app). \r\n\r\nOpen the app from the `dist` folder. For ARM64 based Macs: `specter-desktop/pyinstaller/electron/dist/mac-arm64/Specter.app`\r\n\r\nOpen the app to register the URI handler. You also need to set a remote specterd server and run it locally. Best is to use a different port than `25441` otherwise the app is complaining that the address is already in use (not completely sure why, but this is for dev only anyways).\r\n\r\nSo if you run for example:\r\n`python -m cryptoadvance.specter server --debug --config DevelopmentConfig --port 25442`\r\n\r\nYou have to set in the Electron app:\r\n<img width=\"808\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop/assets/70536101/dcb56678-3d62-478a-82b9-717f7d8e1aea\">\r\n\r\nThe last step closes the app. \r\n\r\nNow you can either directly use this test URL to import a multisig wallet or open the app and then click on the link in a browser tab:\r\n\r\n[specter://?action=importWallet&data=%7B%22label%22%3A%22Swan%20Vault%20(created%20via%20Specter)%22%2C%22blockheight%22%3A0%2C%22descriptor%22%3A%22wsh(sortedmulti(2%2C%5B7737acb8%5DtpubD6NzVbkrYhZ4X3vCdevm3aFUdeSAWsbR4UhhdApbXnVUnvuwtq5NYqQ7zCkNhYG4JcPdGW4Wg4ZrVSYGpdoWsn337qmkP6CFgs7pZid12Sa%2F0%2F*%2C%5B8c24a510%2F48h%2F1h%2F0h%2F2h%5DtpubDDzWqfZ5TH48383Byd9PFGxEP1Ws5NVXyYcHTmnHwmhJciowLeBDWNHcpLGocofanSyVHeiNqL4HZkXZfKM7NKm7gZZoPjmA9vTKPpwRSkx%2F0%2F*%2C%5Bdcbf0caf%2F48h%2F1h%2F0h%2F2h%5DtpubDFd7VxopNeZg93uqR7CSvJLkw3UanF8rywdQTxhCPFt1P33eZkxJJ91XXEbY2Q4Suw3jyscRwGzjVyfgq97N7sRvPHQVxruHwsKvsvQizSk%2F0%2F*))%23g890ye6p%22%2C%22devices%22%3A%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22other%22%2C%22label%22%3A%22Cloud%20Key%20Zoo%20Where%22%7D%2C%7B%22type%22%3A%22jade%22%2C%22label%22%3A%22Jade%20Ghost%20Machine%22%7D%2C%7B%22type%22%3A%22jade%22%2C%22label%22%3A%22Jade%20Keen%20Join%22%7D%5D%7D](specter://?action=importWallet&data=%7B%22label%22%3A%22Swan%20Vault%20(created%20via%20Specter)%22%2C%22blockheight%22%3A0%2C%22descriptor%22%3A%22wsh(sortedmulti(2%2C%5B7737acb8%5DtpubD6NzVbkrYhZ4X3vCdevm3aFUdeSAWsbR4UhhdApbXnVUnvuwtq5NYqQ7zCkNhYG4JcPdGW4Wg4ZrVSYGpdoWsn337qmkP6CFgs7pZid12Sa%2F0%2F*%2C%5B8c24a510%2F48h%2F1h%2F0h%2F2h%5DtpubDDzWqfZ5TH48383Byd9PFGxEP1Ws5NVXyYcHTmnHwmhJciowLeBDWNHcpLGocofanSyVHeiNqL4HZkXZfKM7NKm7gZZoPjmA9vTKPpwRSkx%2F0%2F*%2C%5Bdcbf0caf%2F48h%2F1h%2F0h%2F2h%5DtpubDFd7VxopNeZg93uqR7CSvJLkw3UanF8rywdQTxhCPFt1P33eZkxJJ91XXEbY2Q4Suw3jyscRwGzjVyfgq97N7sRvPHQVxruHwsKvsvQizSk%2F0%2F*))%23g890ye6p%22%2C%22devices%22%3A%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22other%22%2C%22label%22%3A%22Cloud%20Key%20Zoo%20Where%22%7D%2C%7B%22type%22%3A%22jade%22%2C%22label%22%3A%22Jade%20Ghost%20Machine%22%7D%2C%7B%22type%22%3A%22jade%22%2C%22label%22%3A%22Jade%20Keen%20Join%22%7D%5D%7D

This PR schould change that so that a default node is no longer needed.\r\n* a91d33101cf13cc6f885961db0b4f65b786feb57 changes the auth method `rpcpasswordaspin` which is used by raspiblitz to no longer use the default node. Instead it now simply assumes that there is an active node connection and if that is not the case, it searches the harddrive in the folder `/mnt/hdd/bitcoin` for a `bitcoin.conf` file and uses the connection details in that file to validate that the rpc-connection is valid with the password the user has provided. If that folder changes for some reason, it can be changed via modifying the `RASPIBLITZ_SPECTER_RPC_LOGIN_BITCOIN_CONF_LOCATION` env var. If the connection is not available (e.g. node down) the user can still login as the password is validated in that case with string comparison. `src/cryptoadvance/specter/server_endpoints/auth.py` was heavily refactored.\r\n* With a default-node, there was always a node available. It was one which got persisted but might not be connected properly. So to make it smooth for the rest of the code, there is now a `class NonExistingNode(PersistentObject)`. Whenever there is no node, then instead of `None`, an instance of this class is returned. It returns some minimum values which probably should get shrinked even further if we would continue to refactor the frontend-code.\r\n* The WalletManager had an unrelated bug which was solved here as well: It stored the version of the core-node it has been initialized with but did not adjusted it, if the rpc-connection changes. As we're no longer throwing away the Walletmanager, this is quite important also if you have more than one node.

not implemented in spectrum which results in \"method not found\"\r\n2. There was an unrelated KeyError which occured in Transactions where one the output was a change-address. It's a bit unknown why that hasn't occured earlier. At least it was diffcult to spot as the `fetch_transactions` call was way to huge and very confusing. So ...\r\n3. the `fetch_transactions` call was refactored in its own class, `TxFetcher`. As we did that, we also moved two other related files in a newly created wallet-package.\r\n4. Tiny bug around `tx[\"amount\"]` which only exists as `tx[\"flow_amount\"]` for transactions.", "created_at": "2023-03-22T16:51:21Z", "updated_at": "2023-03-27T19:22:57Z", "closed_at":

overview. I don't know why we had the view there in the first place (and it didn't filter by service ids). All the transactions of the withdrawals are by definition UTXOs since they come from Swan withdrawals.\r\n- Allowed hostnames reduced to localhost to match the current state on the Swan backend. We will adapt this as soon as the backend allows it. Special feedback for Umbrel users with a hint on how to make the plugin work by running Specter locally and connecting to Umbrel electrs.\r\n- Better UX in settings overview (e.g. mentioning the email confirmation of the wallet on the Swan side ...)\r\n- Info about the current working solution (if the user is already signed in, linking of the account works, if not the oauth2 flow breaks when accepting the scope of the Specter client)\r\n\r\n#### Misc\r\n- Dev helper styled\r\n- Associate with service styled\r\n- Remarks on how to use USB signer with a remote Specter changed and styled",

immutable buffers. **CVE-2023-23931**\n* Updated Windows, macOS, and Linux wheels to be compiled with OpenSSL 3.0.8.\n<p>.. _v39-0-0:</p>\n<p>39.0.0 - 2023-01-01\n</code></pre></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:</strong> Support for OpenSSL 1.1.0 has been removed.\nUsers on older version of OpenSSL will need to upgrade.</li>\n<li><strong>BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:</strong> Dropped support for LibreSSL &lt; 3.5. The new\nminimum LibreSSL version is 3.5.0. Going forward our policy is to support\nversions of LibreSSL that are available in versions of OpenBSD that are\nstill receiving security support.</li>\n<li><strong>BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:</strong> Removed the <code>encode_point</code> and\n<code>from_encoded_point</code> methods on\n:class:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.EllipticCurvePublicNumbers</code>,\nwhich had been deprecated for several years.\n:meth:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.EllipticCurvePublicKey.public_bytes</code>\nand\n:meth:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.EllipticCurvePublicKey.from_encoded_point</code>\nshould be used instead.</li>\n<li><strong>BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:</strong> Support for using MD5 or SHA1 in\n:class:<code>~cryptography.x509.CertificateBuilder</code>, other X.509 builders, and\nPKCS7 has been removed.</li>\n<li><strong>BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:</strong> Dropped support for macOS 10.10 and 10.11, macOS\nusers must upgrade to 10.12 or newer.</li>\n<li><strong>ANNOUNCEMENT:</strong> The next version of <code>cryptography</code> (40.0) will change\nthe way we link OpenSSL. This will only impact users who build\n<code>cryptography</code> from source (i.e., not from a <code>wheel</code>), and specify their\nown version of OpenSSL. For those users, the <code>CFLAGS</code>, <code>LDFLAGS</code>,\n<code>INCLUDE</code>, <code>LIB</code>, and <code>CRYPTOGRAPHY_SUPPRESS_LINK_FLAGS</code> environment\nvariables will no longer be respected. Instead, users will need to\nconfigure their builds <code>as documented here</code>_.</li>\n<li>Added support for\n:ref:<code>disabling the legacy provider in OpenSSL 3.0.x&lt;legacy-provider&gt;</code>.</li>\n<li>Added support for disabling RSA key validation checks when loading RSA\nkeys via\n:func:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.load_pem_private_key</code>,\n:func:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.load_der_private_key</code>,\nand\n:meth:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.rsa.RSAPrivateNumbers.private_key</code>.\nThis speeds up key loading but is :term:<code>unsafe</code> if you are loading potentially\nattacker supplied keys.</li>\n<li>Significantly improved performance for\n:class:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead.ChaCha20Poly1305</code></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
